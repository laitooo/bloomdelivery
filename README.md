# BloomDelivery

This project was build for the pupose of job assignment in 4 days.

A simple delivery app built in Flutter (Dart).
* The project separates the data logic from the UI logic and uses Provider as a middle-man.
* The project also uses Provider for a state manager.
* The app implements light and night mode.
* The project was developed for the sake of an assessment for joining the Bloom Techno team.

## Features:

* Implement interactive map views for users to select pickup and drop-off locations.
* Integrate location services to automatically fetch and display the userâ€™s current location.
* Allow users to manually move a pin to adjust the pickup location.
* Allow users to search for the place by name using google's Places API.
* Enable users to add multiple stops to their delivery route.
* Update the route and estimated delivery information in real-time as stops are added or removed.
* Create a form to collect the receiver's details: name, contact number, and delivery instructions.
* Display available delivery options with estimated costs.
* Let users select their preferred delivery type and confirm the details.
* Present a list of goods types for users to choose from for the delivery.
* Ensure the selection updates the delivery details accordingly.
* Summarize all chosen details for final user confirmation.
